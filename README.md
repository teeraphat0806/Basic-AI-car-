How AI Learns in the Simulated Driving System 🧩
The AI in this simulated driving system uses Reinforcement Learning, a technique in Machine Learning that allows AI to learn the best way to operate in a constantly changing environment. This learning process involves giving rewards or penalties to encourage the AI to adjust its behavior based on different situations it encounters.

Fundamental Principles of Reinforcement Learning:
Agent:
The AI acts as the agent responsible for driving the car.

Environment:
The simulated road, with its various obstacles and conditions (such as Bot Cars), represents the environment the AI must navigate.

Actions:
The decisions made by the AI, such as choosing a lane, accelerating or decelerating, and changing lanes to avoid obstacles.

State:
The information the AI receives from the environment, including its position on the road, the distance to the car ahead, its current speed, and collision status.

Reward:
The score or reward the AI receives for safe driving and reaching the goal, or the penalties incurred when it crashes or goes off the road.

Algorithm Used for AI Learning:
The AI uses Q-Learning, a fundamental algorithm in Reinforcement Learning that aims to find the best policy for each state to maximize the total reward over the long term.

How Q-Learning Works:
Q-Table:
A table used to store the expected reward values for each state-action pair. This table is gradually filled and updated during the learning process.

Action Selection:
The AI chooses an action in each state based on the values stored in the Q-Table. It may select the action with the highest expected reward (exploitation) or explore a new action to find a potentially better choice (exploration).

Updating the Q-Table:
Every time the AI takes an action and receives a reward or penalty, the values in the Q-Table are updated according to the formula:

Continuous Learning:
